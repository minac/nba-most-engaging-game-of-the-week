  - Lead changes (more exciting)
  - Top 5 team participation
  - Final margin (closer games score higher)
  - Minimum 200 points threshold
  - Star player participation
  - Favorite team bonus
- **Configurable**: Customize scoring weights and preferences via `config.yaml`
- **Real NBA Data**: Fetches actual game data from NBA Stats API

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd nba-most-engaging-game-of-the-week
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

3. Configure your preferences (optional):
```bash
# Edit config.yaml to set your favorite team and adjust scoring weights
```

## Usage

### CLI (Command Line Interface)

Find the best game from the last 7 days:
```bash
uv run python src/interfaces/cli.py
```

Options:
```bash
uv run python src/interfaces/cli.py --help

# Look back 3 days
uv run python src/interfaces/cli.py -d 3

# Set favorite team
uv run python src/interfaces/cli.py -t LAL

# Show all games ranked
uv run python src/interfaces/cli.py --all
```

### REST API

Start the API server:
```bash
uv run python src/interfaces/api_server.py
```

Endpoints:
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/best-game?days=7&team=LAL` - Get best game
- `GET /api/games?days=7` - Get all games ranked
- `GET /api/config` - Get configuration

Example:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/best-game?days=7&team=BOS"
```

### Web Interface

Start the web server:
```bash
uv run python src/interfaces/web/app.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
favorite_team: "LAL"  # Set your favorite team (3-letter code)

scoring:
  lead_changes_weight: 10      # Points per lead change
  top5_team_bonus: 50          # Bonus for top 5 teams
  close_game_bonus: 100        # Max bonus for close games
  min_total_points: 200        # Minimum total points threshold
  star_power_weight: 20        # Points per star player
  favorite_team_bonus: 75      # Bonus if favorite team plays
```

## Scoring Criteria

The engagement score is calculated based on:

1. **Lead Changes** (10 points each)
   - More lead changes = more exciting game

2. **Top 5 Teams** (50 points per team)
   - Games featuring elite teams get bonus points

3. **Game Closeness** (up to 100 points)
   - 0-3 point margin: 100 points
   - 4-5 point margin: 80 points
   - 6-10 point margin: 50 points
   - 11-15 point margin: 25 points
   - 15+ point margin: 0 points

4. **Total Points** (threshold)
   - Games must have 200+ total points
   - Below threshold: 90% score penalty

5. **Star Power** (20 points per star player)
   - Counts participation of star players

6. **Favorite Team** (75 points)
   - Bonus if your favorite team played
